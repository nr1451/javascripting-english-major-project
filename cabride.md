## Julius's Cab Ride from The American Folk Art Museum
"I was confused. I said, I’m so sorry about it, my mind was elsewhere, don’t be offended, ehn, my brother, how are you doing? He said nothing, and faced the road. I wasn’t sorry at all. I was in no mood for people who tried to lay claims on me."

Again, we see this expectation of acknowledgement between Africans in New York. Whether it be a nod from a stranger in Harlem or saying hello to a cab driver, African American culture in New York, as depicted in *Open City*, is such that two people of color will greet each other and acknowledge their shared experiences with prejudice. However, Julius refuses to relate to the cab driver in this way. By stating that the cab driver is "laying claims on him", Julius demonstrates in that moment that he does not identify as African--at least not in the same way that the cab driver does. Julius does not see his experience as similar to other Africans in New York. While he may respect the racial strife that other African Americans experience, Julius does not use their shared encounters with prejudice to form social bonds with other people in the African American community. These social bonds are integral to any cultural or ethnic community, and while Julius may consider himself and African, he does not consider himself a member of this community.
