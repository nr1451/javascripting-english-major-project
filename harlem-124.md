## Harlem 124th Street
"There had earlier been, it occurred to me, only the most tenuous of connections between us, looks on a street corner by strangers, a gesture of mutual respect based on our being young, black, male; based, in other words, on our being “brothers.” These glances were exchanged between black men all over the city every minute of the day, a quick solidarity worked into the weave of each man’s mundane pursuits, a nod or smile or quick greeting. It was a little way of saying, I know something of what life is like for you out here."

The African American community in Harlem is especially tight-knit. There is a culture and language observed in Harlem that is unique and found nowhere else. Here, Julius recognizes the connection he has to other African Americans in Harlem. With a "nod or smile", Julius acknowledges that the racial prejudice that he experiences on a daily basis is something he shares with other people of his skin tone and ethnic roots. While most of our interactions with strangers are superficial, Julius's interaction with these African American males had much more depth. He seems to appreciate that other African Americans in New York share in the struggles he faces on a daily basis. However, this quickly changes when Julius is attacked by these men near 124th street. In this moment, Julius misinterprets their nods as friendly and understanding. This is another example of how Julius identifies with African plight, but does not attempt to connect with other Africans for social reasons. While Julius seems to respect and relate to other Africans in New York, he fails to integrate into their social community.
